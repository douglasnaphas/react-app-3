# react-app-3

Experiment with various React concepts and techniques.

## Install

Install with `npm install`.

## Run

Run with `npm start`. I usually do `PORT=<PORT> npm start`, for example `PORT=3033 npm start`, but any port is OK.

## Concepts

### State shared between a Select and a text field

The app lets you make a selection with a Select, and enter a value in a text field, and runs some function based on the values from both when either changes.
